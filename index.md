Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) involves computing collision-free paths for multiple agents from their starting locations to given destinations in a known environment. This problem finds diverse applications, from robot coordination to traffic management. Researchers in artificial intelligence, robotics, and theoretical computer science have been actively exploring various MAPF problem variants and solution approaches. This workshop aims to bring these researchers together to present their research, discuss future research directions, and cross-fertilize the different communities.


## Topics

All works that relate to collision-free path planning or navigation for multiple agents are welcome, including but not limited to:
- Search-, rule-, reduction-, reactive-, and learning-based MAPF planners;
- MAPF solvers for non-grid non-point agents (e.g. continuous space, robot arms, etc);
- MAPF methods for execution monitoring, replanning, robustness to delays, etc;
- Combination of MAPF and task allocation, scheduling, etc.;
- Real-world applications of MAPF planners;
- Multi-agent machine learning for centralized and decentralized MAPF;
- Customization of MAPF planners for actual robots (e.g. motion and communication constraints, environment changes, etc.);
- Standardization of MAPF terminology and benchmarks.

## Format of Workshop

The workshop is a One-Day workshop including invited talks, paper presentations, Q&As, community discussion, and a newly introduced Industry Panel Session, which aims to foster stronger connections and bridge the gap between industry and the MAPF research community.


## Attendance

The workshop expects to invite 30  participants, including program committees, accepted authors, invited speakers, and researchers who are active in the MAPF community. People who are not invited but are interested in MAPF are welcome to attend.


## Submission Requirements

Submissions can contain relevant work in all possible stages, including work that was recently published, is under submission elsewhere, was only recently finished, or is still ongoing. Authors of papers published or under submission elsewhere are encouraged to submit the original papers or short versions (including abstracts) to educate other researchers about their work, as long as resubmissions are clearly labelled to avoid copyright violations. Position papers and surveys are also welcome. Submissions will go through a light review process to ensure a fit with the topic and acceptable quality. Non-archival workshop notes will be produced containing the material presented at the workshop.

- Format: Any format is acceptable.
- Page limitation: There is no limit on the number of pages.
