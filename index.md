Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) involves computing collision-free paths for multiple agents from their starting locations to given destinations in a known environment. This problem finds diverse applications, from robot coordination to traffic management. Researchers in artificial intelligence, robotics, and theoretical computer science have been actively exploring various MAPF problem variants and solution approaches. This workshop aims to bring these researchers together to present their research, discuss future research directions, and cross-fertilize the different communities.

## Call for Student Travel Grants

Thanks to the generous support of our sponsor Symbotic, we are pleased to announce the WoMAPF Student Travel Grants.
Winners will receive a fixed amount of travel support, which is expected to be around 1,000 USD.
The exact amount will depend on the number of other applicants.

To be eligible, an applicant must be either:
- a student presenting their work at the MAPF workshop,
- a student presenting a relevant paper at the main conference who also plans to attend WoMAPF, or
- a student who does not have a presentation this time, but is very keen to contribute to MAPF studies.

The organizing committee will select several winners based on:
- the applicant's CV,
- a student certificate such as a copy of a student ID card, and
- a one-page PDF description of your contribution to MAPF, not limited to this workshop, and why you need financial support such as travel costs.

Additionally, it would be helpful if you could indicate the amount of other funding you have already received. Priority will be given to students who are actively involved in MAPF, taking into account their place of residence.

Please submit your application via the following page.

[https://forms.gle/13BXVT2fA7tCEaBY6](https://forms.gle/13BXVT2fA7tCEaBY6)

The deadline for applications is __13 January 2025, UTC-12__. Notification is expected within that week.
Instructions for the transfer process will be provided after notification.
We plan to transfer the grants after the workshop day.

We are looking forward to your applications!


## Topics

All works that relate to collision-free path planning or navigation for multiple agents are welcome, including but not limited to:
- Search-, rule-, reduction-, reactive-, and learning-based MAPF planners;
- MAPF solvers for non-grid non-point agents (e.g. continuous space, robot arms, etc);
- MAPF methods for execution monitoring, replanning, robustness to delays, etc;
- Combination of MAPF and task allocation, scheduling, etc.;
- Real-world applications of MAPF planners;
- Multi-agent machine learning for centralized and decentralized MAPF;
- Customization of MAPF planners for actual robots (e.g. motion and communication constraints, environment changes, etc.);
- Standardization of MAPF terminology and benchmarks.

## Format of Workshop

The workshop is a One-Day workshop including:
- Invited talks
- Paper presentations and Q&As
- Community discussion
- Industry panel session

The industry panel, newly introduced, aims to foster stronger connections and bridge the gap between industry and the MAPF research community.

Please note that AAAI requires all presentations to be delivered in person and virtual attendance is permitted for general participation only.

## Industry Panel

We've confirmed the participation from Amazon Robotics and Symbotic – both are leading companies in robotics and warehouse automation. We're also reaching out to other companies who are applying automation in diverse and innovative ways to further enrich the discussions.


## Submission Requirements

Submissions can contain relevant work in all possible stages, including work that was recently published, is under submission elsewhere, was only recently finished, or is still ongoing.

- Format: Any format is acceptable.
- Page limitation: There is no limit on the number of pages.

All submissions will receive at least 2 light reviews.
The review process will be __single-blind__.
