Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) involves computing collision-free paths for multiple agents from their starting locations to given destinations in a known environment. This problem finds diverse applications, from robot coordination to traffic management. Researchers in artificial intelligence, robotics, and theoretical computer science have been actively exploring various MAPF problem variants and solution approaches. This workshop aims to bring these researchers together to present their research, discuss future research directions, and cross-fertilize the different communities.

WoMAPF 2025 is kindly supported by [Symbotic](https://www.symbotic.com/) and [SoCS](https://www.search-conference.org/).

## Invited Talk

Recent Advances in MAPF: Constrained Planning, Temporal Logic, and LLM-Assisted Planning, by [Chuchu Fan](https://chuchu.mit.edu/) (MIT)

<img src="./images/chuchu.jpg" width="200"/>

__Abstract:__
In this talk, we explore recent advances from my group that tackle complex planning challenges in multi-robot systems. First, we present a hierarchical framework for solving the Constrained Multiple Depot Traveling Salesman Problem (CMDTSP), efficiently incorporating real-world constraints such as battery limits and inter-agent conflicts to improve solution quality and computational efficiency. Next, we discuss a novel approach to multi-agent motion planning under complex temporal constraints using signal temporal logic (STL), where timed waypoints enable task allocation and collision-free motion planning for nonlinear and nonholonomic agents. Finally, we introduce AutoTAMP, a method that leverages large language models (LLMs) as translators and checkers to bridge natural language task descriptions with task-and-motion planning, enabling robots to jointly reason about tasks and motion under intricate environmental and temporal constraints.

__Bio:__
Dr. Chuchu Fan is a pre-tenure associate professor at AeroAstro and LIDS at MIT. Before that, she was a postdoc researcher at Caltech and got her Ph.D. from ECE at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Her research group, Realm at MIT, works on using rigorous mathematics, including formal methods, machine learning, and control theory, for the design, analysis, and verification of safe autonomous systems. Chuchu is the recipient of an NSF CAREER Award, an AFOSR Young Investigator Program (YIP) Award, an ONR Young Investigator Program (YIP) Award, and the 2020 ACM Doctoral Dissertation Award.

## Call for Student Travel Grants (Closed)

Thanks to the generous support of our sponsor Symbotic and SoCS, we are pleased to announce the WoMAPF Student Travel Grants.
Winners will receive a fixed amount of travel support, which is expected to be around 1,000 USD.
The exact amount will depend on the number of other applicants.

To be eligible, an applicant must be either:
- a student presenting their work at the MAPF workshop,
- a student presenting a relevant paper at the main conference who also plans to attend WoMAPF, or
- a student who does not have a presentation this time, but is very keen to contribute to MAPF studies.

The organizing committee will select several winners based on:
- the applicant's CV,
- a student certificate such as a copy of a student ID card, and
- a one-page PDF description of your contribution to MAPF, not limited to this workshop, and why you need financial support such as travel costs.

Additionally, it would be helpful if you could indicate the amount of other funding you have already received. Priority will be given to students who are actively involved in MAPF, taking into account their place of residence.

Please submit your application via the following page.

[https://forms.gle/13BXVT2fA7tCEaBY6](https://forms.gle/13BXVT2fA7tCEaBY6)

The deadline for applications is __13 January 2025, UTC-12__. Notification is expected within that week.
Instructions for the transfer process will be provided after notification.
We plan to transfer the grants after the workshop day.

We are looking forward to your applications!
