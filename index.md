Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) involves computing collision-free paths for multiple agents from their starting locations to given destinations in a known environment. This problem finds diverse applications, from robot coordination to traffic management. Researchers in artificial intelligence, robotics, and theoretical computer science have been actively exploring various MAPF problem variants and solution approaches. This workshop aims to bring these researchers together to present their research, discuss future research directions, and cross-fertilize the different communities.

## News

- Oct. 12, 2024: The submission site is now open.

## Topics

All works that relate to collision-free path planning or navigation for multiple agents are welcome, including but not limited to:
- Search-, rule-, reduction-, reactive-, and learning-based MAPF planners;
- MAPF solvers for non-grid non-point agents (e.g. continuous space, robot arms, etc);
- MAPF methods for execution monitoring, replanning, robustness to delays, etc;
- Combination of MAPF and task allocation, scheduling, etc.;
- Real-world applications of MAPF planners;
- Multi-agent machine learning for centralized and decentralized MAPF;
- Customization of MAPF planners for actual robots (e.g. motion and communication constraints, environment changes, etc.);
- Standardization of MAPF terminology and benchmarks.

## Format of Workshop

The workshop is a One-Day workshop including:
- Invited talks
- Paper presentations and Q&As
- Community discussion
- Industry panel session

The industry panel, newly introduced, aims to foster stronger connections and bridge the gap between industry and the MAPF research community.

## Industry Panel

We've confirmed the participation from Amazon Robotics and Symbotic – both are leading companies in robotics and warehouse automation. We're also reaching out to other companies who are applying automation in diverse and innovative ways to further enrich the discussions.


## Submission Requirements

Submissions can contain relevant work in all possible stages, including work that was recently published, is under submission elsewhere, was only recently finished, or is still ongoing.

- Format: Any format is acceptable.
- Page limitation: There is no limit on the number of pages.
